Following is the recipe for making our yummy 🎂Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake🎂:

Take a mixing bowl🥥. Add 120g all purpose flour🍚 in the bowl(Use a strainer🍳). Then, add 25g Cocoa powder🍮 to it(Here, I'm using Hershey's Cocoa powder, you can use according to ur wish). Now, I'll add 1/2 Tsp Baking powder🧂 and 1/4 Tsp Baking soda🧂. Now let's add 1/2 Tsp Vanilla powder🧂(Optional, you can also use Vanilla essence(Same amout)🍸). Now, it's time for sugar🍚 to be added, so I'm adding 125g sugar🍚. After adding sugar🍚, let's also add milk🥛 approx 220ml, cooking oil🍯 - 50ml and lastly 1/2 Tsp lemon juice🍵 for a good flavour. Now let's mix all these components....
🎉Wow!! our batter🥣 is ready to get transformed into a cake🎂!🎉

So, while we were mixing all these ingredients, I kept my cake🎂 tin to get pre-heated since 15 min🕒(You can also make your cake in a pan🍳, microwave📼, etc.)

Now we'll grease our tin with oil🍯 or butter🧈, and then place a butter paper🧻on the bottom and again grease our tin and the butter paper🧻 nicely.
Now, let's pour our batter🥣 into the tin....
After pouring, we'll tap our tin gently so that the batter🍥 spreads nicely in all directions.

Now, let's heat our cake🎂(Cover a plate🍽 above the cake tin) for about 45-50 minutes🕘.

So, while the cake🎂 is getting ready, let's prepare our Chocolate Ganache🍮. So, for making our ganache🍮, First we'll boil some water💧 in a bowl🥥 and keep another bowl🥥 above it(Gas Flame should be between low and medium)...Till the water💧 is boiling, let's chop our Dark Chocolate🍫(150g) into small pieces...
So, the water💧 has boiled, now let's add our dark chocolate pieces🧆 into the bowl🥥 kept above. Here, I'm also adding 60ml milk🥛 along with 1/2 Tsp butter🧈 for a good consistency...
Now, let's stir all the 3 ingredients nicely and gently.
🎉Woah! Our Ganache🍮 is ready!🎉

So, it's already 45 min🕘, now let's check our cake🎂 with the help of a stick.
As you can see, my cake🎂 is ready because no batter is sticking to the stick!
So, now I'll gently take out the cake🎂 tin and place the cake🎂 on a plate🍽 and let it cool on room teperature for sometime...
So, it's already 15 min🕒 since I kept the cake🎂....

Now let's start icing our cake🎂 with the ganache🍮 we prepared earlier.... 
Spread the ganache🍮 With the help of a knife🔪....
So, let's add some mouthwatering chocolate pieces🧆 as we are making a 🎂Truffle cake🎂(Kitkat, Cadbury, Munch, Perk, etc. - 🍫);
(You can also make some flowers🌸 on the top surface of the cake using Whipping cream🍨 and on the borders, you can make some designs using the same cream🍨)(For making flowers🌸, you can use piping bag, etc.)

🎉Whoa!, finally our 🎂Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake🎂 is ready to get served!!🎉

Hope you ❤LOVE IT❤!
